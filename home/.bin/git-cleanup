#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Remove local Git branches that have already been merged.
#
# The script enumerates local branches merged into the current HEAD,
# excludes a small set of long-lived branches, presents the candidate
# branches for review, and deletes them only after explicit confirmation.
#
# Intended use:
#   Interactive repository maintenance to reduce local branch clutter.
#
# Safety notes:
#   - Operates on local branches only.
#   - Deletion is gated by a confirmation prompt.
#   - Behavior depends on the current branch used as the merge base.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Git
#   - Bash
